# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler
Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The starter code uses the Moment.jsLinks to an external site. library to work with date and time, but feel free to use a different JavaScript solution to handle this functionality since Moment.js is considered a "legacy" project. Learn more about some alternative solutions in the Moment.js project status page.Links to an external site.

IMPORTANT
Make sure to clone the starter code repository and make your own repository with the starter code. Do not fork the starter code repository!

Before you start, clone the starter codeLinks to an external site..
